# Hat Game

> :warning: This is a work in progress, not a finished project.

Hat is a Russian party game in which participants try to explain words as quickly as possible without using cognates.

This helper app is designed to streamline the game process: break participants into teams, generate words, keep track of time and score.

The app is written in Flutter, so it's supposed to work on Android, iOS and web. Well, we'll see about that.
