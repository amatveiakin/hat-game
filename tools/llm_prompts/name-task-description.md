I need a name for my mobile game app.

The game is targeted to Russian-speaking and English-speaking audiences and is based on шляпа/alias/taboo family kind of games. It basically is all those games and more. The core gameplay is to explain words to your partner as quickly as possible without cognates.  Plus additional features on top: taboo words, custom dictionaries, a mode where one needs to explain auto generated portmanteau words that we called pluralias (from plural + alias) and others.

This is what I want from the name:
* Plays on the words hat/шляпа or the general concept of a headpiece.
* May hint towards the versatility of available play modes.
* Should not focus too much on any specific game mode (like taboo or pluralias) since none of them is core to the game.
* Works well in English and Russian. Or at least one of them.
* Bonus points if the name is funny or contains a pun. Could be sarcastic too.
* Is memorisable and googleable.
* No issues with copyright, trademarks and things like that.
* Available in Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
* Matching domain name is available. This part should be relatively easy since I’m ok with non-standard top-level domains. I’m particularly in the .pro domain because I have a related website on it.
* Can (but doesn’t have to) contain random references for anchoring and uniqueness. For example, one competitor app is called “Hat 42”, which I think is genius, because it’s unique, memorable, googleable, doesn’t focus on any specific game mode, and it’s a fun reference in itself. I would particularly appreciate references related to science, space, math, languages, romance or great works of fiction.

Attached in a spreadsheet with some name ideas and my comments on them. Feel free to elaborate on my ideas or come up with completely new ones. The name doesn’t have to satisfy all criteria. If an option is particularly good in some respects, I would be happy to investigate it even if it’s lagging behind on others.
