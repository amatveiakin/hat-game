pluralias_help: |
  What is *pluralias*? It's a portmanteau word that combines _plur**al**_ and
  _**al**ias_ by common letters.

  In this mode the app will automatically generate such portmanteau words (call
  them pluraliases), and you need to explain them. The source words are taken
  from ordinary dictionaries. The words are used as is, without abbreviations or
  alterations. Words always intersect by at least two letters, so
  _mo**tor**rent_ and _mot**or**acle_ are pluraliases, but _moto**r**ock_ is
  not.

  To get the most fun out of the hat with pluraliases, we recommend not to view
  it as competitive, but rather to relax, choose simpler dictionaries and try to
  explain each combined word by its meaning as a single entity. For example, you
  could explain *ancientity* as “a very very old item”, *flightning* as “the
  process or trying to escape an electric shock from the sky” and *miracleaning*
  as “tidying up the apartment with divine power”.

  Oh, and don't worry if you had zero pluraliases explained in the first five
  rounds. It gets better! And it's fun anyway :)
